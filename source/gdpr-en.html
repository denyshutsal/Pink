        How we use cookies. Keeping it as simple as possible

      <h3 class="about-gdpr__subtitle">How we use cookies</h3>
      <p class="about-gdpr__text">
        Just like most websites, we use cookies, which give us the opportunity
        to render services to our readers, see that our services are available
        and have not failed, as well as analyze data and understand what we
        are doing wrong, and how we should proceed with developing our
        editorial and advertising products. In this document, we explain how
        we use cookies, and what readers can do about it (if they want).
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-gdpr__subtitle">What are cookies?</h3>
      <p class="about-gdpr__text">
        For some reason, the British call them “biscuits.” But Internet
        cookies are slightly different. A cookie is a data fragment from a
        website you have visited that is stored on your computer.
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-gdpr__subtitle">Which cookies do we use and why?</h3>
      <p class="about-gdpr__text">
        Statistics cookies: we use several systems to collect statistics, as
        it is important for us to know how people read us. Based on this data,
        we can understand the size of our audience, and what we are doing
        right or wrong. We collect statistics through our partners: Google
        Analytics, Yandex Metrika, and Mediascope (formerly known as TNS).
      </p>
      <p class="about-gdpr__text">
        Advertising: we use ad serving platforms (Google DFP and AdFox) to
        show you contextual ads relevant to your preferences.
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-gdpr__subtitle">
        What should you do if you don't want to use cookies?
      </h3>
      <p class="about-gdpr__text">
        You can disable them using your browser’s security settings. An
        important note: the settings should be applied to all browsers you use
        (both on your computer and smartphone). If you choose to disable
        cookies, please note that some Meduza services will no longer be
        available to you, or may operate unpredictably.
